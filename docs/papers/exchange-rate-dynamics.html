    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We estimate an open economy New-Keynesian model using shadow rates to investigate the impact of unconventional monetary policies on euro-dollar exchange rate dynamics since the Global Financial Crisis. Our approach incorporates shadow interest rates to capture the effects of unconventional monetary policy measures, including quantitative easing and forward guidance. The model reveals that unconventional monetary policies have significant effects on exchange rate dynamics, with shadow rates providing a more accurate representation of monetary policy stance than conventional interest rates during periods of zero lower bound constraints.
