    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We model secular trends and cyclical changes of the predictive density of US GDP growth and document a substantial increase in downside risk over the last 30 years. Conditional skewness moves procyclically, implying negatively skewed densities ahead of recessions and positively skewed distributions in expansions. Our approach combines a time-varying parameter vector autoregression with a flexible distributional assumption that allows for time-varying skewness and kurtosis. The model delivers superior density forecasts relative to standard benchmarks and provides new insights into the evolution of macroeconomic tail risk. We show that downside risk has increased substantially since the early 1990s, with the most pronounced changes occurring during the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. The procyclical nature of conditional skewness suggests that policymakers should pay particular attention to downside risk during economic expansions, when the probability of large negative shocks is typically underestimated.
