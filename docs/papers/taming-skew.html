    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Inflation risk in U.S. data varies significantly over time and often exhibits asymmetry. We introduce an econometric model with time-varying asymmetric risk that improves forecasting accuracy and formalize the resulting policy wedge within a DSGE framework, deriving implications for optimal monetary policy. Our approach allows for time-varying skewness in inflation innovations, capturing periods of deflationary and inflationary tail risk. The model reveals that asymmetric inflation risk creates a policy wedge that affects optimal monetary policy responses. We show that accounting for time-varying skewness improves inflation forecasting accuracy and provides new insights into the evolution of inflation risk over time.
