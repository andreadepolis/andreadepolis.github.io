  <div class="abstract" id="abstract-momentum-crashes">
    The return on conventional momentum portfolios exhibits a predominantly negative, time-varying skewness,
which deepens during momentum “crashes”. This has important implications for the portfolio risk-return
trade-off: the relationship between the expected return and volatility is time-varying and depends on conditional skewness. We explore the economic underpinnings of time-varying skewness by timing the capital
exposure to a momentum portfolio in response to fluctuations in risk. The results show that a dynamic
skewness-adjusted maximum Sharpe ratio strategy outperforms popular volatility targeting approaches. Finally, we show that momentum skewness cannot be fully reconciled with an asymmetric exposure to upside
and downside market risk.
