    <strong>Abstract:</strong> We provide evidence that US equity momentum returns exhibit time-varying skewness which deepens during dramatic losses. Hedging for volatility and skewness risks in real time delivers superior performance relative to volatility-managed strategies. Our approach uses a flexible econometric framework that allows for time-varying higher moments in momentum returns. We document that momentum crashes are characterized by extreme negative skewness, and that this skewness risk varies systematically over time. The results suggest that traditional momentum strategies can be significantly improved by accounting for time-varying tail risk, providing new insights into the sources of momentum profitability and crash risk.
