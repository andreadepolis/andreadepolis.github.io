      <title>The Taming of the Skew: Asymmetric Inflation Risk and Monetary Policy</title>
      <link>https://andreadepolis.github.io/workingpapers/inflationrisk.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inflation risk in U.S. data varies significantly over time and often exhibits asymmetry. We introduce an econometric model with time-varying asymmetric risk that outperforms a state-of-the-art symmetric model in forecasting accuracy and achieves results comparable to those of professional forecasters. Skewness in the inflation distribution introduces a wedge between the expected value of future inflation and the modal forecast. We show that this wedge can be formalized within a linear-quadratic DSGE model by deriving the \textit{beliefs representation of asymmetric risk} of that model. This approach enables us to solve analytically for optimal monetary policy in stylized models and to explore the implications of skewed risk on macroeconomic outcomes in quantitative DSGE models. The optimal policy requires the central bank to take measures that shift the modal forecasts for inflation in the opposite direction of the asymmetric risk. We demonstrate the practical implications of this policy approach by aligning the beliefs representation of a quantitative DSGE model to reflect the inflation skewness estimated by the econometric model using U.S. data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time-Varying Skewness and Momentum Crashes</title>
      <link>https://andreadepolis.github.io/workingpapers/momentum.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We provide empirical evidence that the returns on US equity momentum exhibit a time-varying skewness which deepens during dramatic losses (crashes). As a result, the dynamics of the strategy expected returns reflects the time variation in {\it both} conditional volatility and skewness. This has first order implications for managing risks associated with momentum investing: an adjusted momentum portfolio which hedges in real time for both volatility and skewness risk outperforms benchmark constant and dynamic volatility-managed momentum strategies. This result holds for different levels of transaction costs and risk aversion and cannot be reconciled by the exposure to standard equity risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing for Conditional Skewness with _Epsilon-Skew-t_ Distributions.</title>
      <link>https://andreadepolis.github.io/workingpapers/skewt.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I develop a parametric test to detect the presence of instability in the third moment of
time series data. The test is based on the score function of the flexible &lt;em&gt;Epsilon-Skew-t&lt;/em&gt; distribution,
and belongs to the class of Lagrange Multiplier tests. The test presents appropriate asymptotic
properties, as evaluated by means of an extensive Monte Carlo analysis. When applied to the three
asset pricing anomalies of Fama and French (1993), the test points at an overwelimg evidence of con-
ditional non-Gaussianity at the daily frequency, whereas weaker results are observed at the monthly
frequency. These results should be taken as a warning of possible misspecification of asset pricing
models based on symmetric likelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exchange Rate Dynamics and Unconventional Monetary Policies: It&#39;s All in the Shadows</title>
      <link>https://andreadepolis.github.io/workingpapers/exchagerate.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we estimate an open economy New-Keynesian model to investigate the impact of unconventional monetary policies on the exchange rate, focusing on those adopted since the Global Financial Crisis in the euro area and in the United States. To this end we replace effective, short-term, interest rates with shadow rates, which provide a measure of the monetary stance when the former reach their effective lower bound. We find that since 2009, unconventional monetary policies significantly affected the dynamics of the euro-dollar exchange rate both in nominal and real terms. While the stimulus provided by the Fed prevailed between 2011 and 2014, contributing to the weakening of the dollar, in most recent years the depreciation of the euro mainly reflected the measures adopted by the ECB.&lt;/p&gt;
