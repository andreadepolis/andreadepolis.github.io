      <title>The Taming of the Skew: Asymmetric Inflation Risk and Monetary Policy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inflation risk in U.S. data varies considerably over time and has often been asymmetric. A
model incorporating time-varying asymmetric risk achieves better forecasting accuracy than a
state-of-the-art symmetric model, providing results comparable to the performance of profes-
sional forecasters. The optimal monetary strategy calls for the Central Bank to counterbalance
shifts in the direction of inflation risk by adjusting its inflation target –a strategy we term risk-
adjusted inflation targeting (RAIT). By adjusting the modal inflation scenario, the Central
Bank can realign average inflation with its desired long-run inflation objective and effectively
anchor the private sector’s expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taming Momentum Crashes</title>
      <link>https://andreadepolis.github.io/workingpapers/momentum.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We provide empirical evidence that the returns on US equity momentum exhibit a time-varying skewness which deepens during dramatic losses (crashes). As a result, the dynamics of the strategy expected returns reflects the time variation in {\it both} conditional volatility and skewness. This has first order implications for managing risks associated with momentum investing: an adjusted momentum portfolio which hedges in real time for both volatility and skewness risk outperforms benchmark constant and dynamic volatility-managed momentum strategies. This result holds for different levels of transaction costs and risk aversion and cannot be reconciled by the exposure to standard equity risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exchange Rate Dynamics and Unconventional Monetary Policies: It&#39;s All in the Shadows</title>
      <link>https://andreadepolis.github.io/workingpapers/exchagerate.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we estimate an open economy New-Keynesian model to investigate the impact of unconventional monetary policies on the exchange rate, focusing on those adopted since the Global Financial Crisis in the euro area and in the United States. To this end we replace effective, short-term, interest rates with shadow rates, which provide a measure of the monetary stance when the former reach their effective lower bound. We find that since 2009, unconventional monetary policies significantly affected the dynamics of the euro-dollar exchange rate both in nominal and real terms. While the stimulus provided by the Fed prevailed between 2011 and 2014, contributing to the weakening of the dollar, in most recent years the depreciation of the euro mainly reflected the measures adopted by the ECB.&lt;/p&gt;
