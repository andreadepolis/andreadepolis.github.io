Inflation risk in U.S. data varies considerably over time and has often been asymmetric. A
model incorporating time-varying asymmetric risk achieves better forecasting accuracy than a
state-of-the-art symmetric model, providing results comparable to the performance of profes-
sional forecasters. The optimal monetary strategy calls for the Central Bank to counterbalance
shifts in the direction of inflation risk by adjusting its inflation target –a strategy we term risk-
adjusted inflation targeting (RAIT). By adjusting the modal inflation scenario, the Central
Bank can realign average inflation with its desired long-run inflation objective and effectively
anchor the private sector’s expectations.
