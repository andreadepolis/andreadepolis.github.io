      <title>The Taming of the Skew: Asymmetric Inflation Risk and Monetary Policy</title>
      <link>https://andreadepolis.github.io/workingpapers/inflationrisk.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We develop a tractable methodology to analyze the implications of evolving asymmetric risks in dynamic general equilibrium frameworks. Optimal policy calls for the central bank to lean against the balance of inflation risks, thereby mitigating their influence on agents&amp;rsquo; expectations. Using U.S. data, we show that inflation risks are time-varying and typically asymmetric. Using a quantitative model, we evaluate how these risks affect the macroeconomy and evaluate how a policy responding to real-time estimates of the balance of risks would have changed U.S. macroeconomic dynamics during the post-COVID rise in upside inflation risks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time-Varying Skewness and Momentum Crashes</title>
      <link>https://andreadepolis.github.io/workingpapers/momentum.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We provide empirical evidence that the returns on US equity momentum exhibit a time-varying skewness which deepens during dramatic losses (crashes). As a result, the dynamics of the strategy expected returns reflects the time variation in {\it both} conditional volatility and skewness. This has first order implications for managing risks associated with momentum investing: an adjusted momentum portfolio which hedges in real time for both volatility and skewness risk outperforms benchmark constant and dynamic volatility-managed momentum strategies. This result holds for different levels of transaction costs and risk aversion and cannot be reconciled by the exposure to standard equity risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tracking weekly activity using new data sources</title>
      <link>https://andreadepolis.github.io/workingpapers/realtimeforecasting.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Policymakers increasingly rely on real-time measures of economic activity to inform decisions, yet official statistics are typically available only with substantial delay. This paper develops a methodology to extract information from high-frequency indicators in order to produce weekly estimates of official monthly statistics in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on real-time tracking and nowcasting models, our approach addresses two challenges inherent in alternative indicators: the absence of seasonal adjustment and the prevalence of outliers. We incorporate seasonal components directly into the model, allowing the seasonal structure of low-frequency data to inform high frequency proxies, and employ fat-tailed distributions to mitigate the influence of large, infrequent shocks. Applying our methodology to UK data, we track retail sales, monthly GDP, and vacancies using proxies such as debit card spending (Revolut) and online job advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that weekly estimates improve real-time prediction of official releases and highlight the usefulness of high-frequency alternative data.&lt;/p&gt;
