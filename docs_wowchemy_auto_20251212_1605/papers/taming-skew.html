    We develop a tractable methodology to analyze the implications of evolving asymmetric risks in dynamic general equilibrium frameworks. Optimal policy calls for the central bank to lean against the balance of inflation risks, thereby mitigating their influence on agents' expectations. Using U.S. data, we show that inflation risks are time-varying and typically asymmetric. Using a quantitative model, we evaluate how these risks affect the macroeconomy and evaluate how a policy responding to real-time estimates of the balance of risks would have changed U.S. macroeconomic dynamics during the post-COVID rise in upside inflation risks.
